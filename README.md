<h1>Deep-Learning-Plant-Disease-CNN-Classifier</h1>

<p>This repository contains the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for identifying diseases in plants, specifically potato plants. This state-of-the-art model is implemented using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, which are both powerful and flexible frameworks for deep learning tasks.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of deep learning for the critical task of classifying plant diseases. The model is trained on an image dataset composed of both diseased and healthy plant samples. The diseases that the model can identify include late blight, early blight, and healthy plant states for potato plants. The use of CNNs enables the model to extract important features from the images and improve the accuracy of disease classification.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>This project requires a Python environment and several libraries. Ensure you have the correct versions installed to avoid any issues:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Python 3.8 or later</li>
    <li>TensorFlow 2.8.0</li>
    <li>Keras 2.8.0</li>
    <li>Numpy 1.20.3</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>This project is structured as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Dataset Preparation:</strong> The dataset comprises images of potato plants divided into 3 classes: healthy, late blight, and early blight. The images are labeled according to their disease state.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The Keras ImageDataGenerator class is used to perform image augmentation. This includes scaling the images, performing rotation and width/height shift augmentations, etc. This ensures the model generalizes better and prevents overfitting.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Definition:</strong> A sequential CNN model is defined with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. The activation functions, number of nodes, and other hyperparameters are chosen for optimal performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size that can be adjusted according to your system's resources. Both training and validation accuracy and loss are monitored for each epoch to assess the model's performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The performance of the trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset that the model has not seen during training. This provides an unbiased assessment of the model's predictive power.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> The final trained model can be used to predict the disease state of new plant images. It returns the disease class with the highest probability.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>After installing the necessary libraries, clone this repository to your local machine. You can then run the main script in your Python environment to train and evaluate the model. It's important to note that due to the heavy computational requirements of the model, it's recommended to run the script on a machine with a capable GPU.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>During the model training process, it achieved a validation accuracy of 95.31%. Furthermore, when evaluated on the unseen test dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 93.75%. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying plant diseases from images. We hope that such models can be applied in the field to provide real-time assistance to farmers and agricultural workers.</p>

<h2>Saving and Loading the Model</h2>

<p>The trained model is saved using TensorFlow's model.save() method, which allows it to be loaded later for predicting diseases on new images. The model's architecture and learned weights are stored, enabling you to resume training or make predictions without having to retrain the model.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Impact</h2>

<p>This Deep-Learning-Plant-Disease-CNN-Classifier is not just a scientific exploration of deep learning capabilities but an effort to bring tangible benefits to the agricultural community. For centuries, farmers have relied on traditional methods to identify and treat plant diseases. These methods can be time-consuming and often require the expertise of agricultural scientists. However, with a deep learning-based plant disease classifier, the process of identifying plant diseases becomes faster and more accessible.</p>

<p>Farmers can simply capture an image of their crops using a standard smartphone and run it through the model to get an instant diagnosis. By getting timely information about the health status of their crops, farmers can take the necessary steps to treat the diseases, resulting in healthier crops and potentially higher yields. Furthermore, it could assist in the early detection of an outbreak, thereby minimizing crop losses and potentially saving millions in the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>While this specific model has been trained to identify diseases in potato plants, the same methodology can be applied to other types of plants as well. This underscores the flexibility and scalability of this approach. As this technology becomes more widespread, it can help farmers all around the world to grow healthier crops and sustain their livelihoods in a rapidly changing world.</p>
